# Before Planet Express

Bender was built in the year 2996 in Tijuana, Mexico. He was built without a backup unit, which is meant to help him backup data so that if his body were destroyed he could upload his data into another body if he wants. Without this unit, Bender was recognized as defective and in order not to tarnish Mom's Company he would need to be destroyed. However, Hermes (who worked at Mom's Robot Company as a bureaucrat back then) was in charge of destroying defective robots and chose not to kill Bender. He authorized Bender's approval and Bender left the factory defective and mortal; however, in the episode Ghost in the Machines Bender can possess all electronics (as a robot ghost), meaning he was at least capable of backing himself up.

As a bending unit, he spent his life before he met Fry bending girders to be used for suicide booths. After learning this, he tried to kill himself but was unsuccessful. He gave up on that when Fry claimed that he was his only friend in the future. Along with Leela and Fry, he joined Planet Express as a crew member on January 1, 3000.
