# Personality Trait

Bender is defined as a hedonistic,nihilistic anarchist with absolutely no self-restraint or inhibitions. He will pursue whatever target he sets his mind to and rarely will allow concerns over others get in his way. He is a deadpan snarker who possesses a razor sharp wit, having a pitch black sense of humour rooted in other people's misfortune. He is incredibly crass and vulgar, but at least he doesn't waste time with pretenses and in contrast to Fry, he is substantially more emotionally mature and competent when performing tasks. He often builds himself up as a sociopath but despite this, pangs of empathy overcome him and he's far more doting and attentive towards his friends than he'd like to admit. He generally carries a veneer of a selfish and insensitive robot who usually cares about no one except himself. He has been known for getting the Planet Express Crew into a lot of trouble due to his scheming, yet rarely shows any signs of remorse. Bender has no problem committing most crimes, and will gladly do so, ranging from the petty theft of wallets to more serious crimes like kidnapping Jay Leno's head due to their long feud.[6] Moreover, he also does not have one slight grain of sympathy for anyone on Earth, with two exceptions: Turtles, because he identifies with them, and Fry, whom he considers to be his best friend; at Fry's "funeral," he even admitted that whenever he said "Kill all humans," he would quietly amend it with "Except one."

Though usually rude and selfish, Bender does have a rarely seen soft side. More than once he has saved Fry's life. He was genuinely hurt when Fry kicked him out of their apartment because he was interfering with the TV. He once saved the world from a evil sun flame and no one but Fry knew. He supported Fry's playing of the Holophonor, going so far as to attended one of Fry's concerts. He even shed a tear when Fry told him he was going to propose to Leela, saying "He's all grown up". The rest of the crew are aware of Bender's emotional side and enjoy his hardened, crude exterior and sardonic sense of humour, even if it's geared at their expense. They know that at the crunch, Bender ultimately can be depended on to do the right thing.

In general, though, Bender's behavior is defined by a rude and brash nature as well as excessive use of foul language. He also has many vices: He smokes (because it make him look cool), has done electricity (jacking on), and has had many romantic and sexual relations with women who are usually robots like him. He also drinks heavily; technically, though, this is not a vice, as alcohol fuels his power cellsâ€”if he was not a robot his behavior would be classified as 'alcoholic' but he needs alcohol to stay sober, and has on occasion been known to not-drink to excess and become 'drunk.' Bender is also a kleptomaniac, and can often be seen looting and thieving from his friends and co-workers, especially Amy, who is Bender's favorite thieving victim because she and her parents are rich. He is also an accomplished con artist, having gained Fry's power of attorney.

Bender is a strong proponent for robots obtaining human rights, and gets very upset when he hears people claiming that human life is more important than robot life. When he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, bricks have been seen to fall from his backside on at least one occasion (a reference to the line "shitting bricks.").[7] A brick shaped chute can be seen on his uncovered underside while looking for his missing parts after being stripped down at a chop-shop.[8] He has also shown the qualities of an avid shutterbug: When he is sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, claiming that the event is "neat."
